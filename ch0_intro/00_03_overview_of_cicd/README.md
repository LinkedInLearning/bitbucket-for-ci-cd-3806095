# 00_03 Overview of CI/CD

CI/CD is an acronym for three phases of software development:

- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery
- Continuous Deployment

## Continuous Integration

- Developers work on their code in a local environment and commit their changes to a shared repository on a regular basis.
- Committed code is combined with existing code
- Tests are run to check for errors and confirm requirements

## Continuous Delivery

- Includes an automated build process
- May include additional, higher-level testing
- Results in software that is packaged and ready for release or deployment

## Continuous Deployment

- An automated process that places software in a production environment without human interaction.
- Tests and rules are used to determine if the software is read for deployment
