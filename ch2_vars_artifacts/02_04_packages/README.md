> Repository Access Tokens are per-repository passwords for scripting tasks and integrating tools (such as CI/CD tools) with Bitbucket Cloud. Repository Access Tokens are designed for use with a single application with limited permissions, so they don't require two-step verification (2SV, also known as two-factor authentication or 2FA). Repository Access Tokens are tied to a repository, not a user’s account. This restricts the token’s access to a single repository, providing a more secure solution than user-based authentication methods such as App passwords.
