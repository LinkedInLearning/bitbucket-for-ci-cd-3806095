# 04_01 Next Steps

Thanks for sticking with me to the end of this course.  I hope you enjoyed learning about the different ways we can use Bitbucket Pipelines to automate the CI/CD process.

As you continue working with Bitbucket, come back to this course to review the exercise files and retry the challenges.

Also, tap into the Q&A section to ask a question, provide an answer, or just to participate in conversations with other folks using Bitbucket Pipelines.

I had a great time being your instructor for this course and I can’t wait to see what you build, test, and deploy with Bitbucket Pipelines.
