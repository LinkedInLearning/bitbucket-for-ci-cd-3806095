# 01_02 Bitbucket Configuration Overview

Bitbucket pipelines are configured in a file at the root of the repository named `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`.

- Located in the root of the repository
- Tracked as code along with other files
- YAML Format

At the minimum, a pipeline configuration includes:

- The required keyword “pipelines”
  - identifies the start of specific pipeline configurations

- A start condition, referred to as a trigger
  - used to start pipelines

- Steps that the pipeline will complete
  - units of execution within a pipeline.  This is where the commands, scripts, or other specific actions are carried out.

## SHENANIGANS! :D

If you ever want to check your pipeline for errors, use the [validator for bitbucket-pipelines.yml](https://bitbucket-pipelines.prod.public.atl-paas.net/validator).
