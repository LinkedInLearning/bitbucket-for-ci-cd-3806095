<p>To get the most out of this course, you should have an understanding of Git, Atlassian accounts, and Bitbucket basics.</p>

<p>This course, led by Michael Jenkins, guides you through using Bitbucket Pipelines for your software projects. You'll gain a solid understanding of continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment (CI/CD) as you prepare to leverage Bitbucket Pipelines in these processes. We'll then dive into the details of configuring Pipelines and challenge you to create workflows using custom images, services, and artifacts.</p>

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._

## Instructions

This repository has directories for each chapter of the course.  Within each chapter directory there are directories for each video.  The naming convention is `CHAPTER#/CHAPTER#_VIDEO#`. As an example, the directory named `ch2/02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.

Review the `README.md` file in each video directory for:

- additional information on the course content
- links to references outside of the course
- and specific instructions on how to use other files in that directory.
